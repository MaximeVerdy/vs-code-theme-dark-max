# Darker Dark+

It's pretty self explanatory, this theme is a darker version of Dark+
...with a few other cool tweaks ðŸ˜Ž

I love the default Dark+ theme, but I thought it would be better if it was darker, it's too bright for my liking, made this theme so people who feel the same way can easily get it.
