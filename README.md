# dark max
*a Visual Studio Code theme*

This theme is a more contrasted version of the default dark/dark+ theme ...with a few other cool tweaks â—¼ðŸŒˆ
* *darker background*
* *colors popping off a little bit more*
* *more colors for comments in JS files*

The default Dark+ theme is my favorite but I needed to find my way around my code better ðŸ¤“. This is how this theme was born...
