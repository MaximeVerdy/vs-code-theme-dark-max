# Dark max

This theme is a more contrasted version of the default Dark+ theme ...with a few other cool tweaks â—¼ðŸŒˆ
* *darker background*
* *colors popping off a little bit more*
* *more colors available for the comments in JS files*

The default Dark+ theme was my favorite but I needed to find my way around my code better ðŸ¤“. This is how this theme was born...
